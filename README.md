# TaskFlow

TaskFlow is a modern Task Management Web Application built using **HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript**.

The main purpose of this project was to strengthen my JavaScript fundamentals by building a real-world application **without using any frontend framework**.

Instead of relying on libraries, I focused on understanding how applications are structured, how reusable code is written, how state is managed, and why frameworks like React make development easier.

# Key Learnings

Building TaskFlow helped me understand

- JavaScript fundamentals
- DOM Manipulation
- Event Delegation
- Modular JavaScript
- State Management
- LocalStorage
- SessionStorage
- Drag & Drop API
- Form Validation
- Search Logic
- Filtering Logic
- Responsive Design
- Code Reusability
- Project Architecture
- Debugging Real-world Problems

The biggest takeaway from this project was understanding **why frontend frameworks like React exist**.

Implementing everything manually in Vanilla JavaScript gave me a much deeper understanding of DOM updates, state handling and reusable UI architecture.
